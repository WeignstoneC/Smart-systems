The Smart Door System is an intelligent security setup that makes door access safer and more convenient.
It allows users to unlock doors using technologies like RFID cards, passwords or fingerprints instead of traditional keys. 
The system is designed to provide both automation and real-time security monitoring.

HOW IT WORKS
When a user presents their ID (PIN) the microcontroller checks whether it matches the stored data.
If access is approved the system unlocks the door using a servo or electric lock. 
Sensors then monitor the door’s movement and the system can send alerts when there’s any unusual activity.
